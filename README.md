## Purpose/Report
The purpose of the app is help users decide what to eat based on the time of day. By entering a specific meal time eg, Morning or Afternoon Snack the app will provide a meal suggestion to the user. For example if the user enters Dinner the app will display "Ostritch, rice, egg whites" and if the user enters an invalid option the app will display an error telling the user the option they entered is invalid 
## Design Considerations

## GitHub Utilization 
I used GitHub to upload and save my code, i also used GitHub so that my teacher can access my code 
## GitHub Actions 
I used GitHub Actions to test the code of the app once it was pushed to GitHub, if the test passed then i knew it was safe to merge and if it failed i would see errors so that i could fix it

- Extract the code to any folder on your desktop
- Open the file in android studio
- Wait for everything to finnish syncing 
- Select a device on the emulator
