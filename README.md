## Purpose/Report
The purpose of the app is help users decide what to eat based on the time of day. By entering a specific meal time eg, Morning or Afternoon Snack the app will provide a meal suggestion to the user. For example if the user enters Dinner the app will display "Ostritch, rice, egg whites" and if the user enters an invalid option the app will display an error telling the user the option they entered is invalid 
## Design Considerations
